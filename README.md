# MaxVolIndicator
A group project on helping traders understand what happens on the market right now and make them not start their trades if there is no good entry point.

Each instrument is traded with a specific trading volume. The volume of trades decreases or increases
depending on the price of the instrument.
Our goal is to calculate the trading volumes for each instrument price and show them graphically.
